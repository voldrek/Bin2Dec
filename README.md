# Bin2Dec

`Bin2Dec` is a Java project that provides functionalities for converting between binary and decimal numbers. It allows users to perform two main operations:

- **Binary to Decimal Conversion**: Converts a binary number (up to 8 digits) to its decimal equivalent.
- **Decimal to Binary Conversion**: Converts a non-negative decimal number to its binary equivalent.

## Project Overview

This project was developed in Java, utilizing the `Scanner` class for user input, a `switch-case` structure for operation selection, and specific methods for mathematical conversions. Input validation ensures that only valid binary values are processed, providing an intuitive and reliable user experience.

## Features

- **Language**: Java
- **Main Functionalities**: Bidirectional conversion between binary and decimal
- **Validation**: Input validation to ensure accuracy in conversions

## Development

The development process focused on Java best practices, emphasizing modularity, readability, and efficient data processing. This resulted in a robust application for handling binary and decimal conversions.
